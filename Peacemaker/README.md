# Peacemaker

This is a script with a BasePeacemaker class and 3 derivates: FighterPeacemaker, ArcherPeacemaker and MagePeacemaker. In my shards, I spawn them on towns as a replacement to the instakill guards.

They will attack evil mobiles arround, murderers and will attend to 'help'/'guard'/'peacemaker' yells.

They can be attacked by players and if killed, the attacker receives a kill point. so killing 5 of them will turn the player a murderer.
