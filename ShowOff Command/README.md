## ShowOff Command

This is a Plug&Play staff command to cycle through online players showing off each of them for a few seconds. I've been using it to livestream my shards.

Use the command **[ShowOff** to start/stop the show off.

By default, each player is shown off for 5 seconds. You can change this delay on the Config class of this script.

To install, just drop this script anywhere in your Scripts folder.

Here's a video that demonstrates the show off process: <https://youtu.be/0FJXCp7kLfM>
