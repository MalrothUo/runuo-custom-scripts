## AutoDefend

This script makes PlayerMobiles automatically focus and attack their closest aggressor.

It comes enabled for all accounts by default, but players can disable this feature for their accounts by using the command `[AutoDefend` to toggle it.

To install, just drop this script anywhere inside your Scripts folder.
