# Scroll of Resurrection

This is a scroll that resurrects players and dead bonded pets. The differential is that you can target the corpse of the dead player/pet, besides the mobile itself, to resurrect them. You can sell it on vendors or give as reward to players.

To install, just drop this script anywhere inside your Scripts folder.

Then, to add it in-game, use: **[Add ScrollOfResurrection**
