## Chat Initializer ##

For those who are still using UO Client 5.x or 6.x and would like to make use of the ingame chat.

This script will auto-open the chat client and add the player, based on his current character name.

All you need to do is to drop this script somewhere in your Scripts folder.

Players can use the command `[Chat` to enable or disable the ChatInitializer.

As I'm not using it anymore, I don't have a screenshot of it, but here is a screenshot [posted by another member][1] of community that shows the old chat box:

Note that for it to work you have to make sure the Chat Engine is enabled in the file _Scripts/Engines/Chat/Chat.cs_

It has only been tested with clients 5.x and 6.x. It may not work properly on older or newer UO clients.
