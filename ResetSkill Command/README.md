# ResetSkill Command

This command allows a player to set a given skill back to 0, so they don't need to wait reaching the skill cap to get that skill decreased.

Usage example: `[ResetSkill focus`

If the player types the commmand without an argument or with an invalid skill name, a list of the available skill names will be prompted.

To install, just drop this script anywhere inside your Scripts folder.
