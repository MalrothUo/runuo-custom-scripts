## Look Command

I always wanted to see all the players making a good use of the profile system. But the button seems to be so hidden there in the paperdoll that nobody cares for him. So thought I could create a command to encourage its use.

### How it works

The player types `[look` and target another player, then the paperdoll and a description gump will show up. If they target themselves, a profile gump will open for them to fill up their own profile.

### Installation

Just drop this script anywhere inside your Scripts folder.
