# Party Message Command

This is a plug&play script for player to sends a message to their party. An if no message is set, it lists the party members names and informs who is the leader. The command is [P, to make it easy to contantly use instead of typing "/" (Some international keyboards have a problem with that key, which needs to be used with AltGR).

Usage: **[P (message)**

Example of return if player types only "[p": *"You have 2 fellows in your party: Jane, John. Jane is the leader."*

To install, just drop this script anywhere inside your Scripts folder.
