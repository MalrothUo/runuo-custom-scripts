## ClearOtherFacets Command ##

This script is a rewrite of original [ClearFacet command from RunUO, that helps to keep the world clean _if you use only one facet in your shard_. So you don't need go through all maps typing [ClearFacet.

Just put `ClearOtherFacets.cs` on your Scripts folder, and in-game type:

> [ClearOtherFacets
