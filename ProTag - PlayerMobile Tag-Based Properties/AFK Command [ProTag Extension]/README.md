## AFK Command [ProTag Extension] ##

**Important:** This script requires the *Latest Version of ProTag*.

This is a Plug &amp; Play command that will let your players set themselves in a "Away from keyboard" mode.

Based on the same idea of other afk scripts that have been used by the community: it sends an AFK Message every ten seconds.

The player command is `[AFK`

They can optionally set an AFK Message using: `[AFK <message>`

Another objective of this script is to exemplify the use of ProTags. You can see it in the bottom of the script.

To install it, just drop the file somewhere in your Scripts folder.
